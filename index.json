As such, learning the necessary skills to effectively communicate science is a crucial tool for any young scientist. The Concordia Journal of Psychology and Neuroscience seeks to enhance student life at Concordia University by providing students in the psychology department with unique opportunities in scientific communication, peer-reviewing, and editing. Hopefully, these experiences will enrich their understanding of the scientific process and benefit their future careers.\nWe offer students a traditional route to publishing their research by preparing a scientific manuscript and going through a peer-review process with fellow undergraduate and graduate students in psychology. Graduate students serve as Editors and Reviewers, ensuring that each manuscript is scientifically accurate and eloquently written. CJPN also provides senior undergraduates with editorial experience, specifically, with the opportunity to become a peer-reviewer. These select undergraduate reviewers, in collaboration with graduate student reviewers, will gain sought-after professional skills, as well as an inside look of how the peer review process is conducted.\nStay tuned for our first edition, which will be published to our website in September 2021!\n","date":1609632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609632000,"objectID":"ffe713a8b4fc717a50b41774272f34a7","permalink":"/project/cjpn/","publishdate":"2021-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cjpn/","section":"project","summary":"A student-run periodical that publishes undergraduate scientific research in Psychology and Neuroscience","tags":["Science Communication"],"title":"Concordia's Journal of Psychology and Neuroscience","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jillian Caplan","Vasilis Pallikaras","Peter Shizgal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"4c369184886c8969287d189fbf597a4c","permalink":"/publication/reward-intensity/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/reward-intensity/","section":"publication","summary":"To establish how the brain computes the value of rewards, it is vital to know how reward intensity is encoded. It was hypothesized that reward intensity is encoded in the aggregate firing rate of first stage neurons in the reward pathway, in line with the Counter Model. In a within-subjects dual-lever paradigm, Long-Evans Rats worked for electrical brain stimulation reward of the medial forebrain bundle. Rats chose between stimulation trains containing equal pulse numbers with fixed (ALT) or variable (STD) pulse spacing. The pulse frequency of the STD train was held constant across trials, whereas the pulse frequency of the ALT train was selected randomly from ten values. Rats responded with similar vigour to stimulation trains of equal aggregate spike number, irrespective of the temporal stimulation pattern. Consistent with the Counter Model, present evidence suggests that reward intensity is encoded in the rate of neuronal firing, not in the temporal pattern.","tags":null,"title":"How is reward intensity represented in the rat brain?

Thank you so much to everyone who participated, donated, or sponsored the event. Together, we raised over $10,000 for the Eating Disorders Continuum!\nCheck out this small video of the event that we made for the Raymond James Canada Foundation.\n-ORIGINAL-\nI started Pose for Hope, along with a recovered patient and friend who wanted to give back to the clinic that helped her heal. The Eating Disorders Continuum (EDC) at the Douglas Mental Health Institute supports countless patients who are struggling with eating disorders and mental health issues. Right now, they need our help!\nThrough this fun yoga event, we aim to build hope for patients who are seeking treatment or support, but have yet to receive the help they need. Due to under-funding, so many patients are relegated to the waitlist. Our goal is to raise funds for the EDC, to help the clinic increase patient care. Everyone should have the chance to get help. No one should have to battle these illnesses alone.\nThe Pose for Hope event will raise funds to help the Eating Disorders Continuum of the Douglas Institute.\nHow do I participate?\nVisit our web page to register! (Note: the page has now been taken down)\nConsider creating or joining a team.\nStart fundraising - encourage family and friends to join your team or sponsor you with a donation! Participants who raise $50 will have a spot reserved for them at the event. If you are not interested in attending, you may sponsor the event by donating to a team of your choice.\nWhen and where?\nSaturday, September 26th from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at Pierre Elliott Trudeau Park (6975 Chemin Mackle, Côte Saint-Luc, QC, H4W 3A5) Yoga mats and snacks will be provided Please note that proper protocols for COVID-19 will be implemented.

Mutations in PCP genes cause multi-organ anomalies including dysplastic kidneys. Defective PCP signaling was postulated to contribute to cystogenesis in polycystic kidney disease. This work was undertaken to elucidate the role of the key PCP gene, Vangl2, in embryonic and postnatal renal tubules and ascertain whether its loss contributes to cyst formation and defective tubular function in mature animals. We generated mice with ubiquitous and collecting duct-restricted excision of Vangl2. We analyzed renal tubules in mutant and control mice at embryonic day E17.5 and postnatal days P1, P7, P30, P90, 6- and 9-month old animals. The collecting duct functions were analyzed in young and adult mutant and control mice. Loss of Vangl2 leads to profound tubular dilatation and microcysts in embryonic kidneys. Mechanistically, these abnormalities are caused by defective convergent extension (larger tubular cross-sectional area) and apical constriction (cuboidal cell shape and a reduction of activated actomyosin at the luminal surface). However, the embryonic tubule defects were rapidly resolved by Vangl2-independent mechanisms after birth. Normal collecting duct architecture and functions were found in young and mature animals. During embryogenesis, Vangl2 controls tubular size via convergent extension and apical constriction. However, rapidly after birth, PCP-dependent control of tubular size is switched to a PCP-independent regulatory mechanism. We conclude that loss of the Vangl2 gene is dispensable for tubular elongation and maintenance postnatally. It does not lead to cyst formation and is unlikely to contribute to polycystic kidney disease.","tags":null,"title":"Differential role of planar cell polarity gene Vangl2 in embryonic and adult mammalian kidneys","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
