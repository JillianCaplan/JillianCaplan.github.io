      <description>&lt;p&gt;-UPDATE-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was a huge success! Thank you so much to everyone who participated, donated, or sponsored the event. Together, we raised over $10,000 for the Eating Disorders Continuum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this small video of the event that we made for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rjcfoundation.ca/news/pose-for-hope/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Raymond James Canada Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-ORIGINAL-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Pose for Hope, along with a recovered patient and friend who wanted to give back to the clinic that helped her heal. The Eating Disorders Continuum (EDC) at the Douglas Mental Health Institute supports countless patients who are struggling with eating disorders and mental health issues. Right now, they need our help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this fun yoga event, we aim to build hope for patients who are seeking treatment or support, but have yet to receive the help they need. Due to under-funding, so many patients are relegated to the waitlist. Our goal is to raise funds for the EDC, to help the clinic increase patient care. Everyone should have the chance to get help. No one should have to battle these illnesses alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pose for Hope event will raise funds to help the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fondationdouglas.qc.ca/projects/programme-troubles-alimentaires-parmi-plus-importants-monde/?lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eating Disorders Continuum&lt;/a&gt; of the Douglas Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
